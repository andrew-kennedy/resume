    "summary": "There are a few things you should know about me: I love sofware development and design. I don't just want to improve the software I work on, I want to improve the way I go about learning and improving. The best way I could capture it is that I simply care, a lot. There are many who just get the job done, to whatever minimum standard that entails. I will go home and research and design for hours to come up with the best naming conventions and design patterns for my task at work. I am never just satisfied with designing for the bare minimum, the right now. I want to build for the long term, thinking of people who will maintain my work long after I've gone. I want to design code that is not only functional, but beautiful. Finally, I want to do all of this thinking and learning with a team that is just as excited as me.",
