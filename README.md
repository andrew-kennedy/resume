This is my resume, at least the pure data, conforming to the specification listed over at http://jsonresume.org/schema/.

I may add more in the future, as this is a little restricted in flexibility. However, I love the idea of the resume as data, separated from the presentation layer which I am free to implement however I like. Perhaps I will fork the schema.
